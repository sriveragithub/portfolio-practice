            <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
            <p>I am contacting you regarding the positions of Customer Success Associate and Customer Success Technician with MailChimp. My experience over the past 2 years and my recent studies in JavaScript and HTML/CSS have afforded me the knowledge to provide excellent customer service and maximize the technology/tools I work with. With this position, I would take advantage of the opportunity to use my experience to increase client retention and empower MailChimp customers to meet their goals. I will briefly explain how my experience and studies will be an asset within MailChimp below.</p>
            <p>Over the past 2 and a half years as a Client Success Manager, I have a roughly 90% retention rate among clients I am managing. I have accomplished this through quick and concise communication in Zendesk, providing effective solutions for issues within our software and by acting as a teammate to help my clients achieve their business goals. My clients ranged in size from annual festivals of 5-10,000+ patrons to local Atlanta venues and 25% of my correspondence was over the phone or through in-person meetings. My complete understanding of our Freshtix SaaS platform enabled me to provide solutions unique to each our client’s issues that went above and beyond their short-term needs. I intend to dedicate myself to learning MailChimp’s features inside and out to build a complete toolbox as a Customer Success team member. Which leads perfectly into my recent studies in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I have begun taking courses to develop my skills in each of these languages so that I can broaden this toolbox and be of immediate assistance in these areas. I’ve been taking these courses for 3+ months and plan to continue my coding journey for the rest of my career.</p>
            <p>Personal and professional growth is the area of my life that I take most seriously. Personally, I have a passion for music and cycling that I use to keep a positive disposition on life. Professionally, I am always reaching out to my counterparts at other organizations to learn and network. I have made connections with colleagues across the country and I have set myself a goal of growing my network base by 2/3 contacts per month. These connections I use to learn best practices and brainstorm ideas when working on various projects.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration and your time. In addition to the resume and cover letter on this application, I would love to provide contacts who can vouch for my skills and work ethic.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Skyler Rivera</p>
